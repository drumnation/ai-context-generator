# Meeting Notes

## January 7, 2024 - Test Infrastructure and Performance Improvements

### Progress
1. Fixed all E2E tests
   - Extension activation tests passing
   - Basic functionality tests passing
   - Error handling tests passing
   - React component detection fixed

2. Performance Service Improvements
   - Implemented proper memory tracking
   - Added operation metrics collection
   - Fixed method signatures for file operations
   - Added high memory usage warnings

3. React Component Detection
   - Enhanced JSX detection in markdown generation
   - Added support for arrow function components
   - Improved component type identification

### Current Status
- All 12 test cases passing
- Extension activates successfully
- Memory monitoring in place
- React component detection working reliably

### Next Steps
1. Memory Management
   - Optimize file content storage
   - Implement cleanup for unused resources
   - Add automatic chunk size adjustment

2. Performance Optimizations
   - Fine-tune chunk size and delay parameters
   - Implement file type filtering
   - Add parallel processing for independent chunks

3. User Experience
   - Add estimated time remaining
   - Implement pause/resume UI controls
   - Create detailed error messages

4. Testing
   - Add integration tests for VS Code commands
   - Add snapshot tests for UI components
   - Test progress indicator UI in all themes

### Technical Debt
1. Performance Service
   - Consider consolidating duplicate scanning methods
   - Add more granular memory tracking
   - Implement memory leak prevention

2. React Detection
   - Add more sophisticated JSX parsing
   - Consider using AST for better accuracy
   - Add support for more React patterns

### Decisions Made
1. Adopted JSX-based React detection over import-based
2. Implemented memory tracking at operation level
3. Added high memory usage warnings (threshold: 100MB)

### Action Items
1. [ ] Update performance tuning documentation
2. [ ] Implement memory-aware chunk sizing
3. [ ] Add configuration options for chunk settings
4. [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
