   - Optimization strategies

## Guidelines
1. Test Structure
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test error cases

2. Coverage Requirements
   - Aim for 80%+ coverage
   - Focus on critical paths
   - Include edge cases
   - Test async operations

3. Best Practices
   - Use Jest's built-in assertions
   - Mock VSCode APIs consistently
   - Clean up resources in afterEach
   - Use descriptive test names

4. Documentation
   - Document test setup
   - Explain mock implementations
   - Note test limitations
   - Update coverage reports
