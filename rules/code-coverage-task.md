  - [ ] Establish performance baselines

### Documentation
- [x] Create test patterns for file system operations
  - [x] Document fs mocking patterns
  - [x] Document error handling patterns
  - [x] Document async/sync testing patterns
- [ ] Create testing documentation for remaining services
  - [ ] Document markdown testing patterns
  - [ ] Document DI testing patterns
  - [ ] Document webview testing patterns

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Phase 1: Achieve basic test coverage (50%)
  - [x] Add tests for FileService
  - [ ] Add tests for MarkdownService
  - [ ] Add tests for PerformanceService
  - [ ] Test core utilities
- [ ] Phase 2: Improve coverage quality (75%)
  - [ ] Add integration tests
  - [ ] Add UI component tests
  - [ ] Cover edge cases
- [ ] Phase 3: Comprehensive coverage (90%+)
  - [ ] Add performance tests
  - [ ] Add end-to-end tests
  - [ ] Cover all error scenarios

### Notes
- âœ… FileService tests demonstrate proper patterns for:
  - Mocking both sync and async fs operations
  - Handling nested async operations
  - Error handling at multiple levels
  - Testing complex file tree structures
- Next focus should be on MarkdownService or PerformanceService
- Follow established patterns from FileService tests
- Use proper mocking for VS Code API
- Consider setting up CI/CD for automated test runs
