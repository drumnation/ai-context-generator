# Regenerate Context for New Conversation

This is a template for creating a context handoff. The output should contain two parts:

1. Instructions for the next AI agent:
"I am providing you with context from a previous conversation. Please use this context to understand the current state of the project and continue the work from this point forward."

2. Context Summary:

Write two concise paragraphs describing:

- The original goals of this chat
- What has been accomplished so far
- What specific next steps should be taken

Include @file references for any files that are needed to complete this work, listing them with their full paths and a brief description of their relevance.
